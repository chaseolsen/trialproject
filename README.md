# Tenth Muse Design Trial Project

Technologies used, ReactJS, Express, Webpack, Babel

## Project Overview

Since I used React, I've created development Express Server in NodeJS. I also demonstrate creating an API inside of node to handle GET requests as well. Running the node server will serve on localhost:3000

Running the node server (Any changes to folder or webpack running will automatically restart node server)

```
nodemon server
```

I also used Webpack to transpile all of my JS into client.min.js (Any changes to .js files will automatically run webpack)

```
webpack --w
```
